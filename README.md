# Tech Review - TensorFlow and NLP Applications
## By: Sai Ranganathan 

In this Tech Review, we reviewed the technology of TensorFlow, an open-source software library that is used for machine learning purposes. Through TensorFlow, we can create a machine learning model that will be used to predict using testing and training data. This model will then be evaluated based on its robustness and its utility to the end user of the application. 

In the review, we go through a demo of how to use TensorFlow in order to create a model that will be able to classify movie reviews as being positive or negative through text clustering methods. In addition, we talk about different applications of NLP that is achieved through TensorFlow and is actively being used in the industry by companies like Airbnb and Twitter.
